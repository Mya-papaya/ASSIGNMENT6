# ASSIGNMENT6
# Project Reflection

## Overview
For this project, I followed the tutorial titled *"[Instancing Geometry - Mouse Interactive - TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/community-post/tutorial/instancing-geometry-mouse-interactive-touchdesigner)"* by Noto The Talking Ball. This tutorial provided step-by-step guidance on creating an interactive visual composition using instancing techniques, allowing for dynamic manipulation of geometry with mouse input.

## Process and Modifications

While adhering to the tutorial’s foundation, I introduced several modifications to make the project uniquely my own. Specifically:  
- I adjusted some aspect's **radius** and **constant parameters** to refine the distribution and behavior of the instanced geometry.  
- I customized the **material colors/ attributes** to enhance the visual aesthetic and align with my artistic vision.  
- I incorporated **new assets**, further personalizing the final composition.  

## Lessons Learned
This project deepened my understanding of TouchDesigner’s instancing techniques and interactive controls. Experimenting with parameter adjustments allowed me to see how small changes could drastically affect the overall output. Beyond technical growth, this assignment reinforced the importance of customization in digital art, as even a structured tutorial can serve as a foundation for unique creative expression.

Working on this project has further inspired me to explore interactive visual design, pushing the boundaries of generative art and real-time interactivity.
